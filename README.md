Tools Used :- {Hardware} Basys3 board by Digilent , {Software} Xilinx Vivado Suite 2023.2 ML Edition

This project aims at displaying an image using the Basys3 board with the VGA [Video Graphics Array] interface. To develop this project, one must understand the basics of VGA interfacing.
The VGA interface uses the three primary colors [Red-Green-Blue]. These three colors are varied by varying the analog voltage levels of the Red-Green-Blue pins. The VGA connector (also called the DB-15 connector) has 15 ports. Of these, ports 1,2 and 3 control the Red-Green-Blue signals while ports 13 and 14 control the Hsync and Vsync signals. The rest of the ports are either GND (ground) connection [ports 5 to 10] or NC (not connected) [ports 4, 11-12, 15]. 
This project is divided into three main modules :- The Clock Generation , The Signal Generation & The Image Display. Linter Check is performed on all the modules and no violations have been reported.

The Clock Generation Module generates a divided clock. VGA interface uses a clock frequency of 25.175 MHz. However, I could not generate the exact 25.175 MHz clock [even with the Clocking Wizard of Vivado]. A lot of published work rounded the clock to 25MHz, and achieved the same results. Since the onboard clock of a Basys3 board generates a frequency of 100MHz, we need to divide this onboard clock by a factor of 4 to get the desired 25MHz clock. A D-flipflop is used to divide a clock to half of it's value, hence we have used two D-flipflops in series connection to divide the onboard clock. The onboard clock is fed into the first D-flipflop, whose output is 50MHz. This output is again fed to a second D-flipflop to further divide the 50MHZ
clock to 25MHz. The correspondig testbench are also provided for a quick verification purpose. This divided clock [now 25MHz] will be used throughout the project for the synchronisation purposes. 

The Signal Generation Module generates all the necessary signals that are required to drive the VGA interface. This includes the horizontal and vertical synchronisation signals, which together determine the active video display area of a screen. A
screen(according to the VGA interface) is divided into various sections [more info about this can be found here :- https://digilent.com/reference/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/vga-display-congroller/start]. To generate the signals, we must first design two counters,the horizontal and vertical counters.The horizontal counter counts from 0-to-799 and resets after counting to the last value. The horizontal counter outputs a tick signal which is activated once the count value reaches to 799. This tick signal acts as a enable to the vertical counter. When the tick signal is high, the vertical counter increases it's value by unity. Togther, these two counters inadvertantly point to the address of each pixel on the screen.
(Vertical Count Value, Horizontal Count Value) together represents the coordinate of a each pixel. The horizontal and vertical synchronization modules work on the value of the counters. When the counters output value corresponding to the display area, the Hsync and Vsync signals go high. The sync signals are important and are used later in the project.
